This is a Fitness Application project.

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Cloning this Project from this repo on github and installing node_modules before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Building the App in release Mode

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's Bundle it into an apk file.

1. Open File/Windows Explorer using the command <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd>
2. Navigate to the bin folder of your JDK install version in File Explorer.
3. Launch Command Prompt by "Run as Administrator" from the start menu.
4. Copy and Paste the command
   **for cmd** 
   ```cmd
    cd /
   ``` 
    then press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to navigate to the root directory of the drive.
5. Click on the Folder navigation bar in step one and copy address.
6.  Copy and Paste the command ```cmd cd C/Program Files/Java/JDK-17/bin``` then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, to change directory to the path in step (two).
 >**Note**This is the default path for JDK installations, so check the one carrying your installed version number, mine is "17" that is "JDK-17". The 17 in the JDK represents the version of your JDK installed on your computer, yours can be any version!!!.
7. Type the keytool code... to be continued...

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
